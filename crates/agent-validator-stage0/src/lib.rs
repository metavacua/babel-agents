//! Stub crate — `agent-validator-stage0` (chassis design §3/§8). Implementation deferred to a
//! later B-series plan (B2/B3/B4/B5). This crate exists only so the workspace
//! is structurally complete and `cargo build --workspace` succeeds.
//!
//! `no_std`: stage0 validates a `wasm32v1-none` build attempt itself and
//! must attempt to compile against that same target.
//!
//! `cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)`, not bare `no_std`: matches `agent-core`
//! — a bare `#![no_std]` would break `cargo test` once this crate gains
//! real tests (`E0433: cannot find crate std`).
